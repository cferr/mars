# MARS computer

This is the artifact provided along with the IMPACT'23 submission
"Maximal Atomic irRedundant Sets: a Usage-based Dataflow Partitioning 
Algorithm".

The MARS computer is a Jupyter notebook, which contains pre-computed
examples of applications and their MARS for a certain selection of
tiling hyperplanes. It can be re-executed; the dependences to run it are:

* `islpy`,
* `islplot` (https://github.com/tobiasgrosser/islplot.git),
* `matplotlib`,
* `numpy`
